# libasm

This project is an implementation of several standard C library functions in **x86_64 assembly**. 
## Functions Implemented

The following functions are rewritten in assembly:

- **strlen**: calculates the length of a string.
- **strcpy**: copies a string from source to destination.
- **strcmp**: compares two strings.
- **write**: writes data to a file descriptor.
- **read**: reads data from a file descriptor.
- **strdup**: duplicates a string using `malloc`.
